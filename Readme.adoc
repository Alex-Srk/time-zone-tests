Project can be used to test approaches to working with time zones and helps one wrap their head around it.

== Time zones migration

=== Motivation

Make date-time related operations in the system as consistent as possible without sacrificing too much of the usage ergonomics.

=== Core principles of the solution
:timestamptz: pass:[footnote:[See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html[Postgres documentation] <br/> \
Also: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-timestamp/[Tutorial] (the first result from Google ðŸ™‚ at the time of writing).]]
:localdate: footnote:[This asymmetry is necessary as dates without time cannot be converted back to Local time zone after being converted from Local time to UTC.]

* Force explicit conversions where necessary and automate them if unambiguous.
** Set JDBC and JVM time zones to the product/country time zone via environment variables
** Public APIs communicate in LocalDateTime semantics where possible, the date-time is Local to the product.
** All timestamps in the database are in UTC, mapping Postgres' `timestamp with time zone`{timestamptz} to `java.time.Instant`.
** Only do the conversion from/to `Instant` using the provided utility methods that take configured time zone into account.
** Dates are saved as Local. Example: *Jan 01 2022* in the database means *Jan 01 2022* in the time zone configured for the app and should be used without additional conversion.{localdate}
